> Optimization and Preference Tool for the Improvement of Nuclear Systems

This work is the PhD work of Paul Wilding. It is a project to accomplish multi-objective optimization of nuclear reactor design. It generates a pareto front of optimum designs given the objectives. It uses a combination of Non-dominated Sorting Particle Swarm Optimization (NSPSO), Mixed-Integer Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (MI-NSGA) and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA)
